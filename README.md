# Coursera_Capstone

This repo will be mainly used for the capstone project for IBM Applied Data Science Capstone course on Coursera.


## Week 1: Complete the following:

Create a Jupyter Notebook using any platform that you are comfortable with and do the following:

Write some markdown to explain that this notebook will be mainly used for the capstone project. Import the pandas library as pd. Import the Numpy library as np. Print the following the statement: Hello Capstone Project Course!

Push the Notebook to your Github repository and submit a link to the notebook on your Github repository.


## Week 3 
In this assignment, you will be required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.

Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

Your submission will be a link to your Jupyter Notebook on your Github repository.
